# CoviCaller

**Greetings,**

It gives me great pleasure to announce to you my first venture: ***CoviCaller*** - A website made to solve a critical problem in these pressing times – **Fake contacts offering COVID Services in exchange for money.**

Given our crumbling healthcare system and inefficient government, it is seen that scammers prey on the most vulnerable to extort money. They do so by exploiting the paucity of resources and inducing an urgency to buy. Post the payment, the scammers block the payer and become un-traceable. This has lead to a loss of money, and even lives in some cases.

So how do I intend to solve this problem? It’s simple, I take help of good Samaritans like **you**(*and some JavaScript tutorials!*). The website offers three roles:

1.**Volunteer**:  If you have called any number(s) which offered COVID services and they turned out to be a scam or otherwise, you can let the community know by filling out the form on the website. This takes 3 minutes tops, and can help someone save money and possibly, a life.

2.**User**: You just need to enter the number you wish to verify and all available testimonies show up which instrumentally help you in deciding if the contact is credible. 

**Addittionally**, you can search for numbers by choosing a service(Ex: Cylinders, ICU and so on) And yes, it’s free


*What do I do?* I just manually verify every number that the volunteers submit on the website and remove spam entries(Not everyone is as full of good intent as you are!) and ensure you have a hassle free experience.

NOTE: The Mobile version on the website is still under development. Kindly open the link on your computer
